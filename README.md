## Configuration
##### Dear Instructor
1. When downloading the project from MAMA, please uncomment the definition of `// #define Windows` in Config.h file.
This definition allows compilation on MAMA for tests.

2. When playing make sure to be on english keyboard no caps :)


## Known Issues
* When game ends, the user is prompted to "Press any key to continue". This actually waits for a non-white space and enter instead of any key.
* Game board UI is not very spacious
